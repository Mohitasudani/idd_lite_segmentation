 Driving conditions in India are highly unstructured and diverse, with interesting behaviors of traffic participants, compared to the rest of the world. These driving conditions pose unique challenges that are yet unsolved, for research in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems, and hence offer immense opportunities for possible technical innovations in AI/ML systems for better road safety.  India Driving Dataset (IDD) is the worldâ€™s first dataset of unstructured driving scenarios. This is an open dataset, available for anyone across the world, for research. IDD was released at the first AutoNUE workshop in the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2018 with 50,000 images of ground truth annotation. In the second AutoNUE workshop at the International Conference on Computer Vision ( ICCV) 2019, IDD is expanded to be a multi-modal dataset with more data from stereo camera, LIDAR, and GPS from diverse road conditions.
